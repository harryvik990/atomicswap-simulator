# Atomic Swap Simulator

🚀 **First Open Source Simulator** of *Atomic Commitment Across Blockchains with Evidence Verification* (arXiv:1905.02847v2)

This project visualizes and simulates the atomic swap process across two blockchains using a permissioned witness network for verification, based on BFT (PBFT-style) consensus.

## 🔍 Features
- Atomic swap contract creation (Alice ↔ Bob)
- Witness simulation (3f+1 BFT model)
- Redeem and refund logic visualization
- Transaction graph rendering
- Educational + Modular React components

## 📦 Tech Stack
- React 18
- D3.js or Mermaid (planned for visualization)
- Local state simulation (no blockchain dependency)

## 🛠 Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
